# Rust Asteroids Game

We have designed a new asteroids game through the programming language rust.

## Installation

Make sure to have Rust, cargo and sdl2 installed to run the application.

For installing Rust on a MacOS or Linux OS just simply run this command in terminal to install:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

If you are running a windows computer and need to install Rust use this link to find rustup-init.exe (this will install cargo as well for windows)

```bash
https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html#which
```


SDL2 installation varies across the different operating systems 
so follow the link below and navigate to your correct system for the appropriate file to download.

```bash
https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php
```


For Linux and MacOS users run this line of code to get cargo.

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```



## Running the Game

Simply start the programming by starting up cargo with the command...

```bash
cargo run
```
